title: School's Culmination

# This is a GitHub Pages-hosted site made from Obsidian and packaged with Quartz containing the amalgamation of all of my resources for school.
***

This website contains all the information for all the courses I have in Grade 11 Semester I, and is constantly being updated and improved. Currently the courses contain as follows:

### **[[Biology --- SBI3U1-1 --- Ms. Phung]]**
### **[[French --- FIF3U5-5 --- Mme. Iancu]]**
### **[[Math --- MCR3U5-1 --- Mme. Muere]]**
### **[[English --- NBE3U1-3 --- Mr. Culham]]**


Each subject is divided into different pages for the different concepts we have learned in class, some classes' pages (such as **Biology**) are divided by day because of the fast-pacing of the concepts and the new material every day.

**Each page has notes, examples, and corresponding handouts given if they are memorable.**
