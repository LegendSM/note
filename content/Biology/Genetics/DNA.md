# Nucleic Acid
## Nucleic Acids have 2 groups,
- ## DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)
- ## RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)

### DNA is usually the genetic information for **eukaryotes** and RNA is usually the genetic information for **prokaryotes**.

### Humans and other eukaryotes have DNA inside of their nucleolus however. This RNA doesn't contain any genetic information, but rather acts as a messenger to convey DNA instructions to ribosomes so they make the correct proteins.

# Nitrogenous Bases

One part of each nucleic acid molecule is the nitrogenous base, the nitrogenous base is the part that differentiates the molecule from others and the genetic information is simply determined by the order of nitrogenous bases

There are 4 different nitrogenous bases and types of nucleotides in DNA and in RNA

##### DNA:
- **Adenine** (A)
- **Thymine** (T)
- **Cytosine** (C)
- **Guanine** (G)

##### RNA:
- **Adenine** (A)
- **Uracil** (U)
- **Cytosine** (C)
- **Guanine** (G)

DNA and RNA have the same nitrogenous bases, except for **Thymine** (in DNA) and **Uracil** (in RNA). In DNA, the nitrogenous bases follow the **complement base pairing rule**.

### Complement Base Pairing Rule:
In DNA, there are 2 chains of nucleotides where each nucleotide of one is connected to a nucleotide of the other. The rule says, in brief, that **Adenine can only pair with Thymine or Uracil** and that **Cytosine can only pair with Guanine**. There will never be any pairings that deviate from this rule.

# Nucleic Acid Structure

## DNA is made up of:
- Phosphate group
- Pentose sugar (in the case of DNA, deoxyribose sugar)
- Nitrogenous base (**A**, **C**, **T**, **G**)

### DNA is double-stranded (2 chains of nucleotides)
### DNA is anti-parallel ("strands" going opposite directions, upside-down from each other)


## RNA is made up of:
- Phosphate group
- Pentose sugar (in the case of RNA, ribose sugar)
- Nitrogenous base (**A**, **C**, **U**, **G**)

### RNA is single-stranded (1 nucleotide chain)
