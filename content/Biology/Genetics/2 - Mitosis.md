# Cell Theory:
- ## All organisms are made up of one or more cells
- ## Cells are the units of life
- ## Cells only arise from pre-existing cells

> [!info] What limits cell size?
> The optimal size considers the ability to get nutrients into the cell and waste out of the cell. So the factors become the surface area vs volume ratio for optimal transportation which decides the cell's size. Smaller cells are usually more efficient **with a higher surface area to volume ratio**

# Mitosis Terms

### **Chromatin** - Decondensed, long-stranded state of DNA, chromosomes unraveled. This is how genetic information exists in interphase.

### **Chromatid/Sister Chromatid** - An identical copy of a chromosome, made for mitosis or meiosis where DNA needs to replicate

### **Centriole** - Organelle in animal cells that produces spindle fibres, 2 of them lie at right angles, called a **centriole pair** or a **centrosome** (centrosome not used in class)

### **Centromere** - The area in the middle of a chromosome which joins 2 sister chromatids together

### **Spindle fibres** - Microtubules in all cells that attach to the centromeres of chromosomes to position them

The stages of a cell's life are described in the
# Cell Cycle

- ### Interphase
	- **G1** - The cell grows, carries out its normal function, and organelles increase in number. This is the active period in the life of a cell
	- **S** - Standing for synthesis, this is the phase where the cell synthesizes (creates) an extra, identical copy of its DNA.
	- G2 - The cell prepares for mitosis, the centriole pair replicates.
	- #### This is the longest stage
	- #### It varies in time depending on the species and cell
	- #### This is the active period in the life of a cell where biochemical reactions, protein synthesis, and DNA replication occurs
  
  ‎ ‎ 
- ## Mitotic Phase
	- ### Mitosis - Nuclear Division
		- **Prophase** - The nuclear membrane is dissolving, the centriole pairs are moving to opposite poles of the cell, and the spindle fibres are starting to form from the centrioles.
		- **Metaphase** - The chromosomes are all aligned at the middle of the cell (equator or metaphase plate) and the spindle fibres attach to proteins at the centromeres of each cell.
		- **Anaphase** - The sister chromatids split as the spindle fibres pull them to opposite poles of the cell.
		- **Telophase** - Chromosomes decondense back into chromatin, the nuclear membranes start forming in the 2 new daughter cells, the spindle fibres disappear, and cytokinesis is evident.
		‎ 
	- ### Cytokinesis - Cellular Division
		- #### Starts during late anaphase to early telophase
		- #### Is **NOT** part of mitosis
		- #### Animal Cells:
			- Animal cells aren't rigid so at the metaphase plate, the cell pulls inwards, creating a **cleavage furrow** and completes with 2 separate daughter cells when it meets in the centre.
		- #### Plant Cells:
			- Plant cells are more rigid than animal cells due to the cell wall, so after anaphase the cell forms a **cell plate** at the metaphase plate. This is a preliminary cell wall and grows into one.

> [!info] What produces spindle fibres in plant cells?
> Plants don't have centriole pairs, but they have other organelles which produce the spindle fibres instead.

### Mitosis produces 2 genetically identical daughter cells.
