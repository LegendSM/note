In humans, every body cell (or **somatic** cell) has 46 chromosomes whilst every sex cell (or **gamete**) has 23 chromosomes.

To generalize this number:
- **Haploid** (denoted as n) refers to the number of chromosomes in a gamete of a species.
- **Diploid** (denoted as 2n) refers to the number of chromosomes in a somatic cell of a species.

Every cell except gametes is diploid (has a diploid chromosome number).

Offspring carry genetic information from their parents, when n and n (23 and 23) gametes (half from mom and half from dad) come together it produces a 2n (46) zygote. The zygote then divides by the process of mitosis to become a multicellular embryo.

# What is Meiosis?

### Meiosis is the process by which gametes are formed

An old term for meiosis is "reduction division" since it reduces the chromosome number in the daughter cells by half. Meiosis is necessary to maintain a consistent chromosome number throughout generations and it creates genetic variance.

# Meiosis Terms

### Homologous Chromosome - Homologous chromosomes are chromosomes that are the same size and shape and that have the same genes in the same locations, but don't necessarily have the same instructions for the gene (different allele.) You acquire one homolog from your mom and one from your dad.

### Synapsis - The process by which homologous chromosomes align themselves with each other and form a tetrad

### Tetrad - A pair of homologous chromosomes which are together through synapsis, forming a tetrad is necessary for crossing over

### Crossing Over - The process by which chromosomes exchange genetic information with each other by breaking genes in a location and swapping them, leads to genetic variety

### Chiasmata - The location of crossing over

# How Does Meiosis Create Genetic Variety?

- #### Recombination in prophase I
	- Synapsis occurs (pairing of homologous chromosomes)
	- Chromosomes in the tetrad overlap, break off at the chiasmata, and reattach the broken genes on the other chromosome (**crossing over**)
	- This is called **recombination** and results in a new combination of alleles on the chromosome

- #### Random segregation of chromosomes in metaphase I
	- There are different possible ways for homologous chromosomes to align in metaphase I
	- The maternal chromosomes can all move to the same pole or have a combination of some moving to the same one whilst some moving to a different one and likewise with the paternal chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes pair together, but there's no rules on which side the maternal/paternal chromosomes are located.
	- This results in 2^n different possible gametes from this process

# Stages of Meiosis

## Meiosis has 2 divisions, referred to as meiosis I and meiosis II

### Meiosis I:
- **Prophase** - Same as mitosis, **but homologous chromosomes come together in SYNAPSIS, and CROSSING OVER occurs**.
- **Metaphase** - Instead of all the chromosomes lining up in a single line, **homologous chromosomes align beside each other, making 2 lines of chromosomes where each chromosome faces its homolog**.
- **Anaphase** - Same idea as mitosis, **but instead of the sister chromatids separating, each homolog from a pair of homologous chromosomes separates.
- **Telophase** - Same as mitosis, **but whole chromosomes are in the nucleus with the sister chromatids still attached.

### Meiosis II:
- #### Same exact thing as mitosis, but there is no DNA replication in prophase II.

# Results

### Meiosis produces 4 haploid gametes with unique genetic makeups.
