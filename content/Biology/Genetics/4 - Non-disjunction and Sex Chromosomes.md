# Introduction to Sex Chromosomes

Humans have 46 chromosomes, each arranged in 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes. 22 pairs (44 chromosomes) are called **autosomes** which are common to every person. The remaining 1 pair (2 chromosomes) is/are the **sex chromosomes**. These 2 chromosomes an individual's sex.

Sex chromosomes come in either the larger **X** chromosome or the smaller **Y** chromosome.

XX = Female\
XY = Male

# Non-disjunction

Non-disjunction is the failure of either homologous chromosomes to separate during anaphase I, or sister chromatids to separate during anaphase II. When non-disjunction occurs, there is too much genetic information pulled to one side and too little pulled to another. As a result, this produces some or all gametes with **n+1** or **n-1** chromosomes instead of the usual n.

The offspring from a gamete with non-disjunction will have 2n+1 or 2n-1 in their somatic cells. Having an extra copy of a chromosome is known as a **trisomy** (3 copies instead of 2) whilst having a missing chromosome is known as a **monosomy** (1 copy instead of 2).


# Karyotyping

- Karyotypes are pictures showing the number and appearance of the chromosomes in an organism to diagnose abnormalities. Karyotyping is the process for this.
- Karyotyping is used to test babies for non-disjunction-related disorders before birth, as there will be chromosomal abnormality

## How Karyotyping Works

1. Cell sample is taken from embryo
2. Cell is chemically forced to undergo mitosis
3. Cell is chemically forced to stop mitosis in metaphase where the homologous chromosomes are clear and aligned
4. Chromosomes are photographed and organized into a karyotype

# Examples of Disorders due to Non-disjunction

## Turner's Syndrome (X_)
- Only known viable monosomy in humans
- Called "Monosomy X"
- Appear female but sex organs do not mature and they are sterile
- Symptoms such as short stature, increased weight, "webbed" neck, etc.
- ##### 1 in 3000 live births
## Klinefelter's Syndrome (XYY)
- Have male sex organs, but the testes are abnormally small and produce little testosterone
- Often includes breast enlargement and other feminine body characteristics
- Usually have learning disabilities
- ##### 1 in 500 live male births

## Down Syndrome (Trisomy at chromosome 21)
- Result of a maternal non-disjunction
- Characteristic facial appearance
- Poor muscle tone
- Intellectual disability
- Short lifespan
- Most are sexually underdeveloped and sterile
- ##### Approximately 1 in 800 live births but the odds increase with the age of the mother
